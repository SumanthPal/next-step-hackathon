# next-steps-hackathon
Welcome to Med Observer. We are a group of 4 high school students, and this is our submission for the 2022 next-step hack alpha x hackathon. Med Observer is a web application that helps users find hospitals near them with available hospital beds. Input your city and state to find hospitals near you. Check out bed availability and get directions!


The app is also hosted on Heroku. Check this link to try it out! https://med-observer.herokuapp.com/
